Using only one hand, how many unique chords can you play on a piano keyboard?

Assumptions:

1. Your hand has a span of one octave, from thumb to pinky. When your right thumb is on middle C, your right pinky can just reach high C.
1. Within the span of your hand, your very dexterous fingers can hit any of the keys.
1. Each finger can only press one key at a time.
1. A chord has at least three notes.
1. A 'unique' chord means a unique set of keys on the piano keyboard. A low C major chord and high C major chord involve different keys and count as two unique chords. But alternate fingerings of the same piano keys are not unique chords.
